targets:
  # The 'dev' target, used for development purposes.

  # The deployment targets. See https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/bundles/deployment-modes.html
  dev:
    # We use 'mode: development' to make sure everything deployed to this target gets a prefix
    # like '[dev my_user_name]'. Setting this mode also disables any schedules and
    # automatic triggers for jobs and enables the 'development' mode for Delta Live Tables pipelines.

# The 'prod' target, used for production deployment.
  prod:
      # For production deployments, we only have a single copy, so we override the workspace.root_path default of
      # /Workspace/Users/${workspace.current_user.userName}/.bundle/${bundle.target}/${bundle.name}
      # to a path that is not specific to the current user.
      #
      # By making use of 'mode: production' we enable strict checks
      # to make sure we have correctly configured this target.
